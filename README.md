# Virtual-Healthcare-Bot

**Title of the Project :** Virtual Healthcare Bot

**Idea of Project :** 
            One can communicate with text or voice interface through chatbots and get replies through artificial intelligence. Typically, a chatbot will communicate with a real person. Virtual healthcare bots, or telehealth or telemedicine bots, are Al-driven software systems designed to deliver healthcare services remotely, offering a wide range of benefits in the modern healthcare landscape. This abstract explores the key features and advantages of virtual healthcare bots. These bots leverage artificial intelligence and natural language processing to facilitate communication between patients and healthcare providers. They enable patients to schedule appointments, receive medical advice, and access information about their health conditions through text or video chats. Virtual healthcare bots can also assist in managing medication, monitoring chronic conditions, and delivering mental health support. One of the main advantages of virtual healthcare bots is their accessibility. virtual healthcare bots enhance patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans through personalized interactions. They can provide round-the-clock support, promoting better overall health outcomes. However, data security and privacy concerns must be addressed to ensure patient information remains confidential.

**The Virtual Healthcare Bot project will involve the following key steps:**

Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of user symptoms, and diseases.

Chatbot Development: Develop the chatbot using machine learning algorithms to understand patient questions and provide appropriate responses.

Deployment: Deploy the chatbot to a web-based interface, allowing patients to access medical advice and care from anywhere at any time.

# **Technologies Used:**

Machine Learning (ML): ML is a type of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be trained on medical data to enable the chatbot to diagnose medical conditions and provide appropriate medical advice.

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): APIs allow different software applications to communicate with each other. Healthcare APIs can be used to integrate the chatbot with patients queries to access healthcare services remotely.

Speech Recognition: Speech recognition technology can be used in developing an AI chatbot that can understand and interpret spoken language. This technology can be particularly useful for patients who may have difficulty typing or reading.

# **Work Flow of Project:**

# **Execution Steps:**

**Step 1:** Install the required packages and libraries.

**Step 2:** Collecting the data from Kaggle which contains the symptoms and disease in the dataset.

**Step 3:** Training the symptoms of dataset and performing cosine similarity between the user symptoms and trained dataset using Decision tree and Random Forest alogorithms.

**Step 4:** Web interface is created and user get interacted with the application interface and register or login to the page by entering the details of fields like username, email and password.

**Step 5:** After Successful login user access the chatbot and its services like health conversation, disease prediction, referring hospitals and diet plan generator which are advised by the bot based on user inputs.

**Step 6:** The user-interface is developed with added features like Language Support and Voice Based recognition.

**Step 7:** User can click on the selection language button for website translation in three different languages i.e. English, Telugu and Hindi. This was done by developing through installation of libraries like translator and detect. Translation library makes converts the text from source language to user input language and detect library is used to identify the user input language.

**Step 8:** To make user more convenient we have added a voice based input support where user can give the input in a voice format which will be recognised by the chatbot. This was developed through Webkit Library which is possible to make speech recognition.


# **Results:**

**Home Page:**

This is the first page that appears in our application. Here user can view about the application, features of the application. Here, the user can register for the application and create his/her own account. Now, the user can login after entering the required credentials. The user have to enter the email and password. The password will be appeared as dots because of the privacy and it is called as hashed passwords.



**Sign Up Page:**

![Results_Img2_Signup](https://github.com/SUSMITHABYPO/Virtual-Healthcare-Bot/assets/99654924/d2572ed2-cb8c-4630-b4e8-d62a4d2a2c0d)

If the user has already an existing account, then the user can directly go to the login page and can login into their account with their details which are email and password. If the user doesn’t have an existing account, then they need to register with the username, email and password credentials to save their data for login purpose and accessing the chatbot



**Login Page:**

If the user has already registered then they can directly sign in with login credentials to access the bot else they need to click on the below button “Register now” for registering into the website. The user can access the bot only after the valid authentication of the user.



**Chatbot Accessing:**

After successful login the bot is accessed by the user. The services provided are Language translation, Diet generator, Disease prediction, voice recognition, Referring hospitals and Health Conversation.
